# Prerequisites
NPM (Node Package Manager) is used to install packages. You can use it to install Vue within either a new or existing project. 

You will need to ensure you have Node.js installed along with access to NPM. To check, open up your console and type:

> node -v

> npm -v

# Usage
git clone https://github.com/Shilpa-K07/FundooNotesFrontEnd.git
cd FundooNotesFrontEnd
npm install (npm i)
npm run serve

Go to http://localhost:8080/. If port 8080 is already in use on your machine, the program will specify the available port (incremental) for you.

you can temporarily replace the port using the following command:

npm run serve PORT=8888 

# Running the tests
